    "Certainly! Here's a concise summary of the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: Follows a structured, predefined schema with tables.\n",
    "NoSQL: No strict schema; uses various models like document-oriented, key-value pairs, column-family, or graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: Scales vertically by upgrading hardware; can be costly.\n",
    "NoSQL: Scales horizontally by adding more servers; cost-effective and handles large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: Requires a predefined schema; changes may be complex and downtime-prone.\n",
    "NoSQL: Schema-less or flexible, accommodating dynamic data structures without downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction Support:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: Strong support for ACID properties, suitable for data integrity-critical applications.\n",
    "NoSQL: Varies in ACID support; some sacrifice strict consistency for performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: Well-suited for applications with complex queries, relationships, and transactional requirements.\n",
    "NoSQL: Suitable for rapidly changing data, large datasets, and distributed or horizontally scalable architectures in scenarios prioritizing flexibility and scalability.\n"
